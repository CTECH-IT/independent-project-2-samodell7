    <p class="body-text">Dogs4Diabetes (D4D) is a non-profit organization that is dedicated to training dogs to sense
      and alert irregular blood sugar levels in diabetics. Using their excellent sense of smell, dogs can smell when a
      person has high or low blood glucose level.
      D4D aims to train the dog to react to the smell and alert the diabetic.</p>
